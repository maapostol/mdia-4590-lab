### Introduction
Hey! Thanks for learning about git. This will help you in your careers. Designers thanks for coming along, I swaer this will be relevant to you too. 

I am _very_ excited to see what you build on GitHub.

    echo 'Coding is a fun career';

```

### Branches
This project contains 3 types of branches. Main is used for the production branch, Development is where we add new features, and new branches will be created to resolve our issues.

Never work directly on main. EVER. OR ELSE!!
